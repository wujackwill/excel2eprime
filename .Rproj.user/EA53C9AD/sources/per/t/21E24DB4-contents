# excel2ePrime

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of excel2ePrime is to provide a easy to split experiment sentences by different factors.

## Installation

You can install the development version of excel2ePrime from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wujackwill/excel2eprime")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(excel2ePrime)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r excel2ePrime}
split_basic("D:\\personal\\excel2ePrime\\R\\basic.xlsx","A")
```
```{r excel2ePrime}
split_12("D:\\personal\\excel2ePrime\\R\\12.xlsx","A")
```
```{r excel2ePrime}
split_222("D:\\personal\\excel2ePrime\\R\\222.xlsx","A")
```
